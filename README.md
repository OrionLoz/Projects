Responsibilities at MoneFi included leading development on a crucial project aimed at enhancing lead generation and management. I developed a comprehensive lead generation system that included a lead capture webpage and an administrative lead table, facilitating efficient lead tracking and management.

Designed and implemented an engaging lead capture webpage, which served as the front-end of the lead generation system. This webpage was optimized to attract potential leads and collect essential information from them. Key features of the lead capture webpage included:

• User-friendly interface for effortless lead submission.

• Data validation and verification mechanisms to ensure data accuracy.

• Integration with marketing campaigns and analytics tools for performance tracking.

• Responsive design for a seamless user experience across devices.

In conjunction with the lead capture webpage, I created an admin-only lead table accessible to authorized personnel within the organization. This lead table played a pivotal role in lead management, allowing for:


• Lead Entry: The ability to manually add leads to the system, ensuring that all potential opportunities were tracked.

• Status Editing: A user-friendly interface for updating lead status, making it easy to monitor the progress of each lead within the sales funnel.

• Note Addition: An integrated note-taking feature that enabled team members to document interactions and relevant information pertaining to each lead.

• Customization: The flexibility to customize fields and attributes based on the unique requirements of the organization.
